<h3>File Tagging</h3>
A software that will help users organize their Files on disk using Tags.<br>
• A tag is an arbitrary value that can be associated with a file. (Like names of people, 
places, events, etc.)<br>
• Users will be able to tag their files and locate them using tags.<br>
• A file can be associated with multiple tags, and a tag can be associated with multiple 
files.<br>
• Something like how an email-client help organize emails using 
labels.<br>

The code is written in python programming language and is tested to run on windows and ubuntu systems.
